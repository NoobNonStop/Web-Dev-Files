      <p>This is it! The Commode Meet kicks off! The first speaker goes by the name Shitster the Great or SHister the First, whichever you like and he is truly a major fuck-up! He comes onto the stage and immediately starts cryign and ranting that he's got stagefright and he can't do this and that. Then he gets angry at the organizers for having humiliated him so badly and then realizes that that was the whole point of it. Then he starts punching the mic in his rage but breaks his knuckles trying to do so. He jumps of the stage but in his rage missteos and falls flat to the ground. Shitster the Fucked-Up needs to certainly do some homework!</p>
