	<p>Calling Shitster the First a major fuck-up seems like a mistake! And yeah, it certainly is! The Second Shitster or SHitster of Babylonia is a mammoth fuck-up. Even the Gods would be regretting it after this day. The second fuck-up at first refuses to give a speech and when asked why, says that he believes he's an undercover agent who spies on his nearby grocer since he's seen him doing suspicious activities. WHen asked about the what the suspicions were, the he said that he believed that his nearby grocer is a spy from the underworld who sends message through his vegetables by encoding messages to his friends. When asked how he knew, he said he had seen it all in a dream. We asked him why a grocer would come in his dreams and then he said that he was in an affair with the grocer's wife. We then decided that we had another candidate for the Ultra-Shitster competition. We secided to call the Grocer's wofe to the Meet. After that he said that he liked the way our toilets were made and htat he had shat at lea           st 7 times since the morning so as to get a feel to the toilets. Then suddenly, he scampers away from the function and into the toilet. Guess that's his exit style.</p>
