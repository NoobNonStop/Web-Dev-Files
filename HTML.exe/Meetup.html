  <h2>Dedicated to the Craft of being a shitster!</h2>
  <p>Every year a lot of people shit onto their stuff, and thus gain the tag of 'shitster'. This conference is for all the shitsters of the world where we discuss the shitster theory of intelligence whuch describes how all shitsters have really high IQ and all, and that they shat onto their job purposefully to gain the tag of shitster. The greatest shitster was named Thanos because he shat on his lifeling goal of being the one to wipe out half of the universe's life. And he did so purposefully so that we can get a great movie and enjoy it and make memes on it and whatnot. Fuck man, we shitsters are such great men! So great indeed that common people can't even see it! Hell Yeah!</p>

    <h5>The speakers</h5>
    <h3>Stagefright Speakers</h3>
    <p>Joining us are 23 great shitsters from around the world, better known as World Shitsters because of the fact that their shitting has been able to reduce the world to nothing more than a pile of stupid laughter on most occasions. To top it all, they apparently have stagefright, which is fantastic because we shall be able to see their shitting activities live! Woohoo! I really hope that they shit onto their presentations so that we get a sample of their greatness!</p>
